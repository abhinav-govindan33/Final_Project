# Notes for Final Project

## Questions to be Answered 

1. How statistics and data analysis methods are crucial for arriving
at the result? 
2. What statistical and data analysis techniques were used to arrive
at the results?
3. Communication of the results via different visualisation
techniques.

## Answers
1. We want to study how populations of stars are distributed in different types of galaxies. For example, in a spiral galaxy, how are stars distributed near the centre vs how they are at the spiral arms. We will then compare this to, say an elliptical galaxy and so on. To answer these questions we will need to gather data from a star catalog and plot histograms and other plots to see this. 
2. Create different categories of stars - say based on their spectra. See what fraction of stars fall under this. 
To compare different galaxies, we might need to look at covariance matrix or other multivariate techniques.
